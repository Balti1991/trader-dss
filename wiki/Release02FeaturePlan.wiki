#summary A list of features desirable for the 0.2 release.

Not in any particular order and not a commitment to implement!

== Issues to resolve ==

  * [http://code.google.com/p/trader-dss/issues/detail?id=22 Issue 22] Move DB login details from trader-functions.php into a config file which is also used by the scripts in ~/bin
  * [http://code.google.com/p/trader-dss/issues/detail?id=32 Issue 32] Before things get out of hand we need to get the documentation under control
  * [http://code.google.com/p/trader-dss/issues/detail?id=40 Issue 40] and [http://code.google.com/p/trader-dss/issues/detail?id=36 Issue 36] (done) should be implemented as a general warnings ability that would do routine checks on a selected stock and report things. This could be expanded into a comprehensive set of checks.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/trader-dss/issues/detail?id=39 Issue 39] (done) The current portfolio summary doesn't work with shorts, they just get treated as negative trades and do strange things to the graph and portfolio balance.

== Features to add ==

  * notes fields for trades need to be of type text and the interface needs to allow more editing (larger field window)
  * Documentation of selectable indicators and how to query them
  * Lots more technical indicators
     * chart integration for indicators
  * utility scripts for another exchange (loading share names and historic prices)
  * Test with a second exchange
  * Some support for sectors
    * Better table support
    * Trigger updates?
    * utility script to update sector indicators?    
    * Integration into the web interface and charts
  * A Charts page where you can define and use charts in a similar way to the current queries page
  * Ability to make deposits and withdrawals to a portfolio
  * Need to be able to edit portfolio details
